/* Error Logging Facility

	Information for most users:
	
	Code can log messages with constuctions like this:
	
		llinfos << "request to fizzbip agent " << agent_id
			<< " denied due to timeout" << llendl;
		
	Messages can be logged to one of four increasing levels of concern,
	using one of four "streams":

		lldebugs	- debug messages that are normally supressed
		llinfos		- informational messages that are normall shown
		llwarns		- warning messages that singal a problem
		llerrs		- error messages that are major, unrecoverable failures
		
	The later (llerrs) automatically crashes the process after the message
	is logged.
	
	Note that these "streams" are actually #define magic.  Rules for use:
		* they cannot be used as normal streams, only to start a message
		* messages written to them MUST be terminated with llendl
		* between the opening and closing, the << operator is indeed
		  writing onto a std::ostream, so all conversions and stream
		  formating are available
	
	These messages are automatically logged with function name, and (if enabled)
	file and line of the message.  (Note: Existing messages that already include
	the function name don't get name printed twice.)
	
	If you have a class, adding LOG_CLASS line to the declaration will cause
	all messages emitted from member functions (normal and static) to be tagged
	with the proper class name as well as the function name:
	
		class LLFoo
		{
			LOG_CLASS(LLFoo);
		public:
			...
		};
	
		void LLFoo::doSomething(int i)
		{
			if (i > 100)
			{
				llwanrs << "called with a big value for i: " << i << llendl; 
			}
			...
		}
	
	will result in messages like:
	
		WARN: LLFoo::doSomething: called with a big value for i: 283
	
	Which messages are logged and which are supressed can be controled at run
	time from the live file logcontrol.xml based on function, class and/or 
	source file.  See etc/logcontrol-dev.xml for details.
	
	Lastly, logging is now very efficient in both compiled code and execution
	when skipped.  There is no need to wrap messages, even debugging ones, in
	#ifdef _DEBUG constructs.  lldebugs messages are compiled into all builds,
	even release.  Which means you can use them to help debug even when deployed
	to a real grid.
